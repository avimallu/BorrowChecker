# Development

Install [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), and run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --port 8123
```

If you want to make it available to the local network, run:

```bash
dx serve --port 8123 --addr 0.0.0.0
```

The choice of the `port` argument is up to you. Currently, this app is configured to only be compilable on the `web` platform.
